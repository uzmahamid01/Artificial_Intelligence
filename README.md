# Artificial Intelligence

This repository showcases my work on implementing various search algorithms as part of an Artificial Intelligence class. It demonstrates my understanding of search problems, agent strategies, and heuristic design.

### Assignments:

##### A1: Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search with non-trivial admissible heuristics
